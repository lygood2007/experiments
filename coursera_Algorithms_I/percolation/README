Classes Percolation.java, PercolationStats.java and PercolationTest.java where created on the resolution of the programming assignment 1 (week 1) of the course _Algorithms, Part I_ of Coursera (coursera.org). The first two classes follows the very strict directives of the assignment, including style, memory consumption, runtime performance etc. In the first attempt there were 3 failures (see feedback_1), whose where solved in the second attempt (feedback_2). File animation.txt was created by PercolationTest.java, following the format required by PercolationVisualizer.java. This class animates the percolation process.
