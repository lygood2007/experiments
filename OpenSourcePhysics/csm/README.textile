h3. Computer Simulation Methods (CSM)

This is a Java project I created to study computer simulation methods
for Physics with experiments and exercises from the book
"Computer Simulation Methods", by H. Gould, J. Tabochnik and W. Christian.

h3. Dependencies

Simulations depend on the OpenSourcePhysics library (opensourcephysics.org).
